What is done during the creation of a project?

* Archetype selection 

    First the Archetype Plugin asks the user to select an archetype from a list
    of known archetypes. Archetypes are known using archetype catalogs.

* Archetype configuration

    Then the Archetype Plugin ask the user to provide values for each of the 
    four main required properties. Which are the project's groupId, artifactId,
    version and package. 

    It also ask for values of the additional required properties defined in the
    archetype's metadata file.

* Project generation

    Finally, the Archetype Plugin generates the Maven 2 project from the 
    selected/configured archetype.

    The archetype used to generate the project can be single or multi module.

    The archetype used to generate the project can be partial, which means it 
    enhances an existing project instead of creating a new one.

    If the Archetype Plugin is called from an existing project, using a 
    complete (not partial) archetype, then it generates a sub module in the 
    existing project.

    If the Archetype Plugin is configured to create a project in an existing 
    directory, it first check for the existence of a <<<pom.xml>>> file before 
    failing the generation.

* Batch mode

    It is possible to call the Archetype Plugin to generate project in batch 
    mode (to get rid of the prompting). This is achieved by providing the 
    Archetype Plugin with all the needed values as system properties.

    * <<<archetypeCatalog>>> which defaults to internal specifies the catalog(s)
       The valid catalogs are: internal (the default), local, remote, file://path, http://url. 

       * <<<internal>>> uses an internal catalog 

       * <<<local>>> uses the ~/.m2/archetype-catalog.xml file 

       * <<<remote>>> uses the http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/archetype-catalog.xml 
         file 

       * <<<file://path>>> uses the catalog file defined by path (or the 
         <<<archetype-catalog.xml>>> file located in path directory) 

       * <<<http://url>>> uses the catalog file defined by url (or the 
         <<<archetype-catalog.xml>>> file located in url web directory)

       []
  
    * <<<archetypeGroupId>>> specifies the groupId of the archetype to use
  
    * <<<archetypeArtifactId>>> specifies the artifactId of the archetype to use
  
    * <<<archetypeVersion>>> specifies the version of the archetype to use
  
    * <<<archetypeRepository>>> specifies the repository in which the archetype
      resides
  
    * <<<groupId>>> specifies the groupId of the generated project
  
    * <<<artifactId>>> specifies the artifactId of the generated project
  
    * <<<version>>> specifies the version of the generated project
  
    * <<<package>>> specifies the package for the sources of the generated 
      project
  
    * <<<anotherVelocityProperty>>> specifies any other required property

    []

* Behind a Proxy

    Being behind a proxy is automatically configured by Maven.
