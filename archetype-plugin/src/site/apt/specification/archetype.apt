What is an archetype?

* A Maven 2 project 'en devenir'  

    I.e. an abstract representation of a kind of project 
    that can be instantiated into a concrete customised 
    Maven 2 project. 

    An archetype knows which files will be part of the 
    instantiated project and which properties to fill 
    to properly customise the project. 
 
    Each archetype defines a set of common properties: 

    * groupId which will be the groupId of the project 

    * artifactId which will be the artifactId of the project 

    * version which will be the version of the project 

    * package which will be the base package of all source files of the project

    []



* A jar file

    The minimal content of the jar file: 

+---
.
|-- META-INF
|   `-- maven
|       `-- archetype-metadata.xml  [1]
`-- archetype-resources
    |-- ...                         [2]
    `-- pom.xml                     [3]
+---

    [[1]] The metadata file that defines:  

        * the default values of the common properties, 

        * a set of additional properties with their default values, 

        * a set of archetype resources;
        
        []

    [[2]] The resource files defined by the archetype metadata,

    [[3]] The POM file of a Maven 2 project.

    []


* Note

    The common properties should be renamed to <<<${target.groupId}>>>, ...
    to avoid name clash.
